@AmericanAir Feels like I am being trolled by an airline. I complain about being mislead and then you mislead me again.


@Delta this is ridiculous, my kids and I are stock in #MexicoCity flight DL130 being delayed almost 9 hrs and no one was giving information


Lightly packed Aeronaut fits under unubstructed @Delta seats, making space for passengers with big bags. @tombihn at your service!!


Hey @DeltaAssist Why is @delta lying to pax that DL3754 redirected midflight to @sfairport vs @mspairport b/c of weather when it was deicer?

@AmericanAir yes, the joyous round of applause when the substitute captain just walked on the plane. The lack of info is what made it worse


@AmericanAir That’s fine, but then can you officially post a delay for my flight?


Another @Delta experience, another piece of evidence that the @AirTran  merger was anticompetitive and led to reduced service.


Hey @Delta I'm not making that 5:50 flt.


@SouthwestAir thanks. Is 620 a firm departure time then? Or is it likely to get pushed again?


@delta please tell me this isn't what this seat is like always? Dl1165 10a. 3.75 hours. All the back/ butt pain. https://t.co/JIauvUJgMY

@Delta thanks! We love us some Delta! Thanks for all the rides this year!! https://t.co/1OxFllrPeR


Good news I love it!! https://t.co/zuGGCWbjLH


@AmericanAir 179 JFK-SFO


@AmericanAir just had a very disheartening exec platinum customer service experience at MSP


@PhilipRucker @Delta good! They needed to redeem themselves.


@SouthwestAir you miss the point. It's not the delay, it's your refusal to provide realistic status to passengers. Fix that.


@SouthwestAir at last check others connecting through Dallas weren't adversely impacted


@AmericanAir now I have to wait for a snow storm to calm down AND for a new plane to get cleaned? #delaydelaydelay

@AmericanAir my sister is an unaccompanied minor who's flight was cancelled at o'hare. She's in rebooking line alone, can anyone help her??


@SouthwestAir also, it's 5:33 &amp; were boarding, so your 5:25 status is... exactly what I'm talking about.

@SouthwestAir you're welcome and I didn't even have to go through TSA. :)


@AmericanAir Flight delayed an hr  out of Cincy. Finally boarded but on plane for 45 min while captain "finishes some last minute paperwork"


@Delta so end of the day they say it was a technically not that I don't deserve the lap of luxury lol


@SouthwestAir poor experience with southwest, paid for early bird check in and computer malfunctioned and I didn't get what I paid for.


@Delta we just pulled off plane at gate with no update, gate agent says no plane available


@Delta Are your flights to MDW taking off? Any reports of airport closure?


@AmericanAir I have the worst luck flying into fsm. Half the time it's a maintenance issue. Can we get better planes?

@PhilipRucker @maggieNYT @Delta @AmericanAir I did this on an American Flight once.  It showed up in Lost&amp;Found after several days.


@AmericanAir how is it one bag made my trip and the other is still at LAX. My cost just went up because yr incompetence!


#Sunset @SouthwestAir #SSA2016 https://t.co/J8cCgh720A


@SouthwestAir got all the way to the runway to takeoff. Just as they finished de-icing, ANOTHER 15 min delay. Almost 5 hours in now.


@greta  @delta found and returned my iPhone. I was amazed!


He's still in the bathroom. Maybe he's avoiding all the paperwork he has to do? @AmericanAir


@Delta delayed again. Groundbreaking. Making it really hard for me to switch from AA. Ex play on AA


@AmericanAir Try harder.  There was space avai. Other passengers take more luggage than allowed.  #unfair.  No intention of making us happy

@Delta worst airline ever #Deta


Lady across the aisle just requested a pillow and some vodka.  We're in this together. @AmericanAir


@VirginAmerica your LAX terminal is dirty as fuck, y'all should be embarrassed. I not even wanna sit down on the chairs. Smh!


@SouthwestAir is SW3110 a possibility?


@PhilipRucker @maggieNYT @Delta I should be so lucky. Mine never returned from an BUR-PDX flight. Thieves.


@Delta - Thanks a lot (NOT) for screwing us.  We booked on a 757 from SEA&gt;JFK listed with Live TV and wifi.  You changed aircraft to 767...


@AmericanAir your flight attendant in 1st is AMAZING.  Flight #6046 LAX-&gt;SJC #americanairlines


WHAT IS HE DOING IN THAT BATHROOM?@AmericanAir


@Delta worst airline ever #Delta


@delta big thanks to Jason at the Delta service desk in Terminal E of ATL.  Huge help in sorting out some flight issues today


Looks like my @Delta upgrade has already come through for next Saturday. #thestreakcontinues


@Delta - 767 with no Live TV, so no NYGiants game.  Also, wifi that costs more than a cell contract and works like AOL dial-up circa 1997.


@AmericanAir @JuliofromDallas Lady said since it's a red eye leaving at 1am tomorrow that the $75 doesn't count cause it's not same day.


@MisterPreda is @SouthwestAir @sougonna provide you a hotel


@Delta - just shameful


@Delta I guess the delay isn't 6 hours like last time but the bar is kinda low.


@AmericanAir No I don't understand. 1 broken lav is NO excuse for screwing up &gt;100 ppl's lives. Going to make up for a missed job interview?


@Delta not sure if blasting cheesy music on your planes as frazzled passengers load and get situated counts as C&amp;U Punishment but it should


@Delta ground crew at CLE is NEVER prepared for an early arrival. My good experience always marred by my arr at CLE.


He's out of the bathroom. Now get on that paperwork, procrastination is not a good color on you.    @AmericanAir


@AmericanAir  now flights are being cancelled - we know the snow is ending soon in chicago.  #admityourecancelled.


@MisterPreda is @SouthwestAir gonna provide you a hotel? That eould be nice of them if they do


@greta @Delta I left left my bag on Airport shuttle, where I was going? Australia. Guess what's in that bag? Everything. And I got it back.


Worst experience! Rerouted. Time, AA miles &amp; bag fee wasted. customer service unhelpful. Bag not recovered. No compensation. @AmericanAir


@SouthwestAir Flight 282 looks like it's only delayed 30 minutes out of MDW but flight time looks like 3.5 hours. What's the deal?


@AmericanAir ridiculous as usual the mechanical issue is discovered at boarding time and the plane had been here  an hr


.@knoxapoppin @KymKemp @EelRiverBrewing Plus I got a haircut, &amp; I might wear a hat #GoodTimes #Humboldt #Fortuna #California @VirginAmerica


@AmericanAir also, other airlines are on time to chicago on the MSY board... namely United, for one.


.@AmericanAir - do better. https://t.co/ahuRv6GZfM


I watch these @SouthwestAir commercials &amp; I just think how they should have hired @MiamiVice95 &amp; me instead. #LipSyncChamps


@AmericanAir I'm not sure the printer can handle all of this.  We may need some of those boxes they wheel in to court rooms in the movies.


@SouthwestAir your commercials are comparable to something a 7th grader would make on their YouTube channel with 26 subscribers.


@TaraTV1 @graedrake @SouthwestAir Lol! Reminds me of Ben Stiller in "Meet the Parents"!


@PhilipRucker @Delta Must've found it before the cleaning crew otherwise U could kiss it goodbye. #OutsourcedAirlineJobs


@Delta flight was delayed so missed connecting flight. Can't even try to fly standby bc all flights to ORL are overbooked. AWFUL service.


@AmericanAir thanks! Feel free to #rt


@AmericanAir Phyllis at ATL just gave one of the best customer service experiences ever. Thank you.


@SouthwestAir Nevermind. Just got text alert. Your app needs to be updated faster. Still shows 7:35 departure time.


@SouthwestAir Thanks! MKE 2764

I just saw a plane taxi by us.  Made it feel like we were moving. Weeeeeeee @AmericanAir


@Delta I was scheduled on flight 1964 to jax today and you rebooked me on different flight (1090) bc u didn't think I would make it (1 of 2)


This delay from Denver to Chicago is really frustrating. @AmericanAir


@Delta perhaps you should have your jump seat employees check their bags at the gate instead of forcing paying passengers.


@Delta however I did make it to the gate before scheduled departure only to be told they left early. Now I'm waiting 5 hours. Why rebook me?


@AmericanAir you are terrible at customerService! Even though my GF had 6 hours in between flights, you failed to transport her bag.


@AmericanAir entire plane still waiting by the carousels no bags have come out. Total joke.


@SouthwestAir Thanks for the update!


@UCFChargeOn @Delta @AirTran AirTran merged with Southwest, not Delta.


@xonicolerob @AmericanAir lol why is this totally not surprising


@AmericanAir Two hrs late  &amp; not moved an inch but we should "for safety keep our seatbelts on". Guess I need a belt on my couch too.


@Delta #giveback early Christmas at an orphanage in Lima. https://t.co/wESeuvU5w5


@SouthwestAir Never flying with you again. Worst customer service handing cancelled flights. Wasted an entire day getting nothing but stress


@Delta skymiles acct number 9269855780. If you had not rebooked me on 930 flight, they wouldn't have pushed off early


@AmericanAir again, not interested. You can't help, don't care, I get it. I guess we will have to plan our deaths a little better next time


PAPERWORK ARRIVES!!!  Seems like a small stack for all of this fuss @AmericanAir


@PhilipRucker @Delta *Festivus miracle


@AmericanAir plse don't give me, a 1st cl plat pass, a hard time about my tiny purse that will tuck into other bags. It's not a 3rd item.


@Delta I think you should unban that Trump supporter he was obnoxious and loud I agree but that's freedom of speech!!!


@AmericanAir done


5pm and still sitting on this plane, still sitting by the gate. It's been two hours since we've boarded. Really, @AmericanAir?

@Delta I will never fly Delta again. I missed my 2nd flight because my initial flight was delayed. Now they charge me $50 for later flight.


Thanks @SouthwestAir for four great flights this week, even with today's winter weather in MKE!


@Delta well the comp was wrong and now I'm waiting 5 hours extra hours. Why do I get punished for comp error without compensation?


Three cheers for @SouthwestAir - flight cancelled due to #Chicago crazy #weather - rebooked and ready to go tomorrow. #nofees #nohassle


Hey young world just boarded my @SouthwestAir flight heading back to Atlanta for a studio session #TeamIMS https://t.co/e9Rj9vKLW1

@delta no airline is perfect, but yours earns my business almost every time I fly. Your #OGG customer service are always top knotch. Thanks!


Loving the extra legroom on this newer @SouthwestAir 737! Wish all of my flights were like this


@Delta thanks. Probably won't make it..need to go through customs.


@AmericanAir flight attendant yells at gate agent DCA airport. refuses to board flight. storms off to go eat. flight delayed. #unreal

Fuck you @Delta change the weather ok? peace. Ps you suck


@AmericanAir Has 3380 taken off from ORD yet?


@AmericanAir CVG pulled passengers plane had too much fuel. Was advised get to XNA 34 HRS after scheduled departure and luggage would NOT.


@PhilipRucker @Delta lucky as all hell


@AmericanAir given that the flight you have me on is oversold, a little effort earlier probably would've saved you money. #lame 1/2


@AmericanAir I'm off to buy clothing for my meeting tomorrow and I need my medication by tomorrow as well. Beyond disappointed


@Drisanalg @AmericanAir @Qantas oooh same happened to us flying to NYC for Christmas and AA shirked all responsibility for compensation

@alexrubens @AmericanAir unreal, safe travels!


@Delta how does one delayed flight cause me to get home 24 hours later then planned? Has to be a better way to rebook...maybe I could walk?


@AmericanAir flights. Me and my brother out waiting for our flight back to Portland. But anyone thing you have to offer would be great


Beautiful Pic of downtown. Looks like such a big city. https://t.co/7CpFHeGbtC


@AmericanAir I know the rules. My purse is tiny, can always be put in other bag. super obvious. Does not need to hold up the line for that


@PhilipRucker @maggieNYT @Delta So glad you got it back. Terrible feeling.


@AmericanAir that would be great! But I'm not going to believe that til I see it, and the gate agents don't have the same info....


@AmericanAir I appreciate the apologies but does not make up for it with several delays and rude treatment.Dont think upgrade is.much to ask


@AmericanAir clearly. Your thanks, no thanks, was super supportive. And since you have a monopoly on those flights I have to go to you 1/2


I love ya @Delta and always will...but maybe time to retire this tattered and dirty Delta Comfort seat? https://t.co/FZYqBAzZXL

@AmericanAir thank you.


This commercial where @SouthwestAir employees are all singing and dancing to @Tip is pretty absurd.


Love this @SouthwestAir commercial! You can go wherever you like! Haha!


@SouthwestAir take it back.


@Sudetermined @damselindior @AmericanAir So fucking rude. And this is one of the reasons they are the WORST airline.


@SouthwestAir  been stuck in CLE bc of snow in Chicago Thnks for being so flex and rerouting me to Balt 2nd time saved in two days #winter


@SouthwestAir How much did that commercial cost you?

Why was I made to check my carry-bag when there is PLENTY of room in the overhead bins?! Rows and rows of free space...


@PhilipRucker @Delta https://t.co/cKFZ3Sn2KP


@AmericanAir and don't pee on my face and tell me it's raining and that there is absolutely nothing you can do. You CHOOSE not to help


These @SouthwestAir commercials are 100%. The one with T.I.'s song. Ha! Great marketing.


@Tip your song in the @SouthwestAir commercial nice move


@BarrettSallee @belkbowl @DarenRovelI https://t.co/5qmpBlKUzO

Next time I fly @SouthwestAir, I'm asking for one of those coconut drinks... watch I don't get one :)


@AmericanAir too late for that! That would've been a few hours earlier today.


I will never fly @SouthwestAir again if they continue to advertise with these unbearably bad commercials.


@SouthwestAir you nailed the #whateveryoulike commercial!#winningwithsouthwest


Hey @SouthwestAir not sure I would have put a pilot with a drink in hand in my commercial #optics #messaging #coconutdrinksareforpassengers

What would possess @SouthwestAir to make a commercial where a pilot walks in dancing holding an alcoholic beverage?

That @SouthwestAir #Transparency commercial w/ the @Tip track is funny! That pilot though. Lmao! #YouCanHaveWhateverYouLike #Southwest

Hey i have flight from DC to San Antonio i tried to add my Alfursan number to sky miles but i couldnt.

@SouthwestAir Charmaine in the New Orleans airport is an amazing customer service agent. She was very nice and very helpful.


I didn't think it possible, but @SouthwestAir made a commercial more annoying than the Journey themed commercial...… https://t.co/UJALhjGUvX


C'mon @SouthwestAir we've been pulled back to the gate TWICE, still sitting in Vegas. A/C doesn't work either, pretty ridiculous!


Hey @AmericanAir, booked a 2pm flight tomorrow from LGA&gt;ORD and I can't check in.


@jefe_miller Yeah the stupid @SouthwestAir ones are a big ugh to me...

@AmericanAir I'm waiting a compensation! Could you please be se kind to give me MY money back? Thank you.


@SouthwestAir Your new commercials are amazing! Give the marketing engineering team a bonus. #MyFavoriteAirline


@Delta 5hrs delay is too much. Being happening quite often with delta. Inconvenient for frequent flyers.


@AmericanAir we have those, but they don't correspond w/times on the board or the phone call updates we get, or often with the gate agents.


How possible that a standard beer on @AmericanAir costs more than same said beer at @nationals Park? Perhaps paying extra for the ambiance


@MrsTruj @SouthwestAir @MiamiVice95 At least you two would be funny.


The most devastating thing about this @Delta flight is not the two crying babies in the row behind me, it's that I can't watch free movies.


@SouthwestAir spoke to manager Laura heart who said ok to get off with ID (took boarding pass when loaded plane) and then changed her mind


@Delta 

Yeah i have it should i share it here or DM?


@VirginAmerica I paid for a direct flight!!! Not a layover flight 357!


@SouthwestAir once I was off the plane with out my stuff. In times like this everyone does better when there is clear leadership and comm


Thank you @delta for your handling of my flight delays. Very accommodating and helpful!


@Delta appreciate the quick initial tweet back - however I've had radio silence since. We need to get home tonight. This is ridiculous.

@Delta we're still sitting in at gate ATL, is this flight going to OK City tonight?


@Delta thanks. If I cancel an entire booking of two flights. How much refund do you get?


@AmericanAir @KarenBrown I believe it was missing for 2 weeks. AA team responded with blank stare when questioned why. Hope you'll retrain


@Delta @CXAlert first flight as #diamondmedallion and got downgraded... feels a little backwards


Wow! https://t.co/gJDj8Pwja9


@Stan_Cherry @SouthwestAir @MiamiVice95 and it would look like we were actually singing.


Poor attitude from gate agents @AmericanAir claiming carry on bag won't fit. Finally convinced them. Looks like it… https://t.co/E6huHSOlly

Gracious peace https://t.co/MS35KW8tYC


@AmericanAir aa4421 we all get off the plane just to get back on? This isn't weather, this is mismanagement! What is going on!?!?


finally leaving the gate sitting in 1st class &amp; attendants in galley shooting the shit, no offer of drink during boarding @delta Flight 4790

Some fun sights in @TSAIAirport. @conocophillips/@BP_America has a ticket counter, while @AmericanAir is on vacation https://t.co/xSnG3vV2BD


@AmericanAir might just change my return plans.


@AmericanAir can you explain why not?You offer free upgrades when there are no problems. Will be my last trip on American.


@llamers Hello Lynn, It is our pleasure assist and serve you! Thank you for being the most important part of @Delta. #KeepClimbing! :-) *CK


@Delta just realized I left my kindle and chargers in a green bag in the seat pocket of 22A on DL1574. Any chance of getting it back?

@Delta can you please provide an update? Blake Boldon 1567


@LisaLive5 @SouthwestAir Wow,not something you experience everyday!


@AmericanAir  I was told the plane is too small. why some people get to keep their bag when I don't. I paid for my ticket as well


Anchorage! https://t.co/IGyy4vtpyG


@VirginAmerica 11:45 landing!!!! #357 increased by an hour?!?


Nice High School Musical reference, @SouthwestAir! https://t.co/XNsTTAAaeo


@AmericanAir this is the 4th time this year that I've experienced this happening...same flight attendant each time...hmmm


Nothing is worse than empty apologies @iflymia  @AmericanAir #overit #justwannabehome 

Airports are the worst!


Yeah, Wikipedia says that AA only operates to Anchorage from DFW, LAX and PHX seasonally... https://t.co/7ROVrnkr8B


Ufff, @AmericanAir 4.5 hr delay? How's the even possible? Flight AA6006


Would you look at that. I tried giving @AmericanAir another chance. After my last abysmall trip. Nope 2hour delay AGAIN. No more. #lasttime


Hey @Delta how about giving passengers w &lt;30min connection a chance and offer other passengers a chance allow us to deplane first?


Wow. American never fails to disappoint. You are totally winning the race to the bottom @AmericanAir


@Delta @JohnSharkman since we have your attention, can we address people getting line an hour before boarding???


@AmericanAir my bag was less than 10kgs I don't understand your carry on policy which is completely unfair.

@AmericanAir could you provide an estimate for new departure time?


I wonder what @SouthwestAir spends on peanuts &amp; sodas each year and why other airlines don't think their customers are worth that much.


@MootePoints @KrisKling @Delta the woman in 1A flight flt 341 is not worthy of your 1st class upgrade. She is devaluing your brand.

@BertShowBert @KrisKling @Delta you mean this person? I agree!!! https://t.co/0f6p4Jpq3i


@AmericanAir love the circular argument since I will end up exactly where I am now. With a NO and a place at the table empty for the funeral

Thanks @united for being helpful and rebooking my flight when @Delta gave me nothing for a delay that made me miss my connection home


@SouthwestAir why is Nashville to Dallas-Love Feild never apart of your sales?


@UCFKnight234 @Delta @AirTran Indeed, Southwest pulled down ATL hub giving DL free reign; SW lied to DOJ about intentions to compete.

@Delta have an itinerary on Delta locator that includes a segment on Westjet. Would love the WS locator so I can change seats


@SouthwestAir can u get us on a new safe plane instead of this one that the engines won't start?!

@MilesKISW @SouthwestAir its hard to explain to someone when you are late for a connecting flight and go from A to C seating!


@SouthwestAir why did you need to cancel Hartford flight to Chicago? Other airlines were flying and it looked like snow would stop later.


@SouthwestAir it just went from 10:50 back to 6:10 can you confirm?


@delta how do I submit a customer service complaint? I had the worst customer service experience with your airline.


@rafaelduerksen @Delta  We can look this up for you if you could send us a direct message with your full name, travel info and email... 1/2

@BertShowBert @Delta @KrisKling that poor gal barley made it to rope 13 where I'm at... I told her to Keep on keepin on


@AmericanAir but unlike you they did the right thing.


Another reason to keep loving @SouthwestAir https://t.co/aGzO3vyUdQ


Terrified to fly. But have to tomorrow. The company hooked me up with a non-stop flight ... that @AmericanAir just canceled. Help me, Jesus.


@AmericanAir your airline is terrible. You tell me the flight is on time and it is clearly not  it wasn't even at the gate at departure time


@AmericanAir flight 1033


Can't wait to get my @delta survey for this flight. #majorfail


@Delta I need some help with a personal situation in regards to my flights tomorrow. Could I get someone to dm me for assistance?

@AmericanAir Been delayed in ATL for 7 hours. Lunch at the Grindhouse. Dinner at PF Changs. It's all your fault. Flight 4676 ATL - MIA.


When this happens, how is the baby's birth city and state decided? By whatever airspace they were over? https://t.co/peR69zj4x1

@VirginAmerica you broke my wheelchair. Please help!!


@WestJet @Delta Thanks just DM'ed


This would never have happened on @SouthwestAir If only it wasn't $550 one way to get home


@AmericanAir Flight AA 3686 is waiting on AA 3808 for 1 crew member for 2 hours now??? Planning is not AA's strong suit huh?


Trapped in Philly due to crew issues &amp; weather but all @AmericanAir gives me is a number to call about hotel discounts. Very impersonal!

@Delta 1)Sit down until your Zone is called 2) if you are really worried about overhead space, check your bag 3) Seek Chill, people


@Delta flight DL3645 4hour delay?


@southwestair what ID does my 14 yr old need to get boarding pass?


Impressed w/ @Delta attendant Marria's Tetris-like arrangement of the luggage compartments and esp her care w/my new hat! DL5697 Thanks!


@Delta I need a hotel voucher


@Delta changed my flight time to 7am for when i go to orlando in 54 days and i'm way okay with that cause it gives me more orlando time, yay


@SouthwestAir I appreciate that. I'm not one to complain. I was simply trying to avoid a potential problem and that's what irked me most


Love watching human flight instructions, relationships should have the same instructions every morning @Delta


Hey @SouthwestAir, looking good. #Denver https://t.co/lwhjWCS2FY


@Delta How do I get the voucher to you to look at?


@AmericanAir 5 hr delay is a little more than a "whoops," no? Like 1 hr. Understandable. 5? Kinda crazy.


Set next to a musician on my @SouthwestAir flight earlier however we didn't really speak and that sucks because he… https://t.co/58wSE5ZRwT


@AmericanAir delayed a full 737 80 minutes bc your gourmet cart was late...seriously? Ridiculous.


Hey @delta do you really need me to fill out a survey after every single flight I take?


Will never fly @AmericanAir every again. I don't think I've ever seen worse customer service. Smug faces, unhelpful directions, the works.


@AmericanAir also just boarded for the 3rd time.


@AmericanAir and now none of the plugs work for chargers and they only have half the food menu.Really embarrassing for American

@SouthwestAir what's going on in Grand Rapids right now is a complete joke your team is not organized.

@AmericanAir premium pricing and sub par service leaves a very expensive bar unachieved


@AmericanAir I think you don't understand the problem. You delay a flight and I had to wait 15 hour in an airport. I want my money back!


@AmericanAir just flew from Chicago to sfo the crew ran out of snacks didn't tell us and just left us with nothing! Very disappointed!


Weather delay Bos to Stl. I hope @SouthwestAir holds my flight to KC tonight! #southwestairlines


@VirginAmerica "winter headwinds are pretty normal".. then why didn't you plan for it #terribleservice #firsttimeflying?


@AmericanAir every flight into Chicago is delayed, why put us on the plane to sit for 2 hours when you knew there would be major delays?


@AmericanAir I can't change my mind because we can't afford an additional $400 expense on top of a funeral. Thanks for nothing


@AmericanAir  i never heard a word.  
I don't expect American Air to do anything to help unless its to line their pockets.

@SouthwestAir - great flight attendants today from Vegas to Wichita. Stanley is about the best announcer I've flown with!  Great job.


@SouthwestAir what is the ID policy for children under 18?  Traveling with an adult companion


@AmericanAir and when the crew lands and they are past their time limit, and we have wasted 6 hours here, to THEN be cancelled? Then what?


@all_airlines Post your @Delta Complaint on https://t.co/nbrmiHdxgA to hold them accountable and get results. #AirlineComplaints


@Delta thx for quick reply. Comfort+ is primo for me!


@Delta it's an awesome change, now to wait til day before the trip to pick seats. can i ask why we have to wait til check in to choose seats


Finding out my @delta flight is delayed because I happened to check the flight status a day before instead of being notified is not okay.

@bbelding @Delta I agree! I love that new feature #mobileworld


Cool!! https://t.co/vTrDSd3xXx


@AmericanAir this is when honesty comes into play - if the gate agents had the authority to call it as it is, there would be less anger.


My husband qualifies for A-list with @SouthwestAir and leaves me behind like Jack on the titanic


@Ookayx https://t.co/K148CGtq1Q

@SouthwestAir sticky trays&amp;peoples snacks from the last flight but pls stick to making jokes while I choose a different airline next time.

@Delta okay. Just making sure app was showing delays and landing after next flight already boards. Thanks for checking


Shout out to @Delta for getting me through to a tight connection then finding me an awesome window seat. #happytraveler #grateful


@Thomasismyuncle @SouthwestAir surely they wouldn't tease us like that


@AmericanAir also, the gate says our departure is 7:30, but that's a lie, because they also say the plane is still in chicago.  Stop lying!


@AmericanAir Now, what is our ETD?


@AirlineFlyer @Delta Who cares where you sit....it's a Boeing.  Of courser, any window seat will do.


@AmericanAir might want to cool off the cabin while people are stuck in it for 30minutes - #weak #ruinedagreattrip #hot

@Delta not cool for a redeye flight when passenger calls to confirm in advance. The gate made up something and the call center blew me off.


@AmericanAir hello.  girlfriend and I were checking in two bags. I'm platinum. we were first told there was a charge! Then referred inside


@Delta 1370; DAL - ATL; time to fly!


@AmericanAir thanks!


@AmericanAir -sucks right now! No communication- people missing connecting flights- 80 degrees on the plane- really?????


@AmericanAir then - the woman at the front diverted me to the "gold line" despite showing her I was platinum in the app


@Delta @Seahawks   So he thinks he has super powers? Tune in &amp; find out! https://t.co/nzyJFyJLtH


@AmericanAir. I check-in in time and then my check in got rejected. Now I have to pay $350 for a new flight? And my orig. flight is empty?!


@AmericanAir I know the weather outside is frightful at ORD, but better communication would be delightful. #3392


@AmericanAir finally the line was insanely long for gold or platinum at MIA, while the coach lines were short.


@AmericanAir and it hasn't even taken off yet.


@SouthwestAir any update on flight 2386 from mdw to bwi?


Stuck sitting on @AmericanAir plane because there is a plane still in the gate we were supposed to arrive at.  #BeBetter #NotCool


@Delta @AirlineFlyer I've spoken to several of your pilots and they echo your excitement.  GR8 aircraft.


@AmericanAir  delayed for 7 hours...hanging with dj many at pf changs...too much time at grindhouse...help. #flight4676


thanks @Delta for the views https://t.co/4ZaUuvzgDJ


@AmericanAir it's been an hour and a half and there's still no plane.....I should be landing by now.....


No kidding @AmericanAir .. #shameonyou #passengerrights  https://t.co/Ruj7VeGc4Z


@Gogo poor inflight wifi on @VirginAmerica sfo&lt;&gt;ewr today. $50/month and this is worst of all trips so far!  No @dish either! Crap flight...


@AmericanAir you say you appreciate, but I need to feel you appreciate.#showmethevoucher https://t.co/HdssKncPHe


@Delta thank you https://t.co/XvPSGYbpxn


@Delta hoping to connect tomorrow through Atlanta and not NYC pls


@AmericanAir all done, I'm at gate. Wanted to ask: do you have wifi onboard AA728?


@FAANews #wheelsupdelay does not stop @fedex but @Delta flight is sitting duck on runway. #Hotundercollar will miss connection.


@AmericanAir another delay at LAX with improper communication and no updates...#AA1576 #NoAAdvantage


Always an adventure, @AmericanAir. https://t.co/NDdXSDCAwO


@SouthwestAir thank you


@SouthwestAir great! #sprintstoairport


@MisterPreda @SouthwestAir Have so much fun!


@DominicCincotta @SouthwestAir thought the same thing when I saw that


Broke my iPad when the bills traded up to draft @sammywatkins over @52Mack_  while @StevieJohnson13 sunk in his @SouthwestAir seat #fact


@VirginAmerica Chat appears to be broken on the site right now. It says we are after hours when that is not correct.


@Delta please help! I just waited 45 min for a callback from customer service only to get pushed to the survey, no one even came on to help!


At the @united customer service desk like - i need you @SouthwestAir https://t.co/S3Hvl9euSp


Well that's an exciting and wild flight into @ExploreCHS!! https://t.co/CDbLvZN3GQ


@AmericanAir Had another good call with a rep. Worked hard to help us book a trip through Europe.


@SouthwestAir we landed at 5:30 and have been sitting on the plane for almost an hour now when there are 2 people sick on board smart MOVE.


@Delta sent


@Delta Thanks, TP. A name was spelled incorrectly on one of my tickets and I need to correct it. Can I do this another way?


@SouthwestAir @Snapchat @Apple #ThanksY'all https://t.co/IZcA6uBUp4


@DELTA Hi! I accidentally left my headphones on my last flight. Who do I need to contact?

@AmericanAir Flght 4625 RDU-JFK. Awesome soccer players returning from #CASLShowcase to Long Island. Safe travels a… https://t.co/3sZayd0h5C


@lovesmangos That's so awful - I hope the @Delta flight staff were informed and polite.


@SouthwestAir  the worst setup ever as an airline we all boarded the plane at 12:55 in Cancun and sat on the plane for 2 hr before take off


@AmericanAir flight 2868 had one of the best, most compassionate &amp; patient crews I've ever seen. So impressed by my airline.


@Delta Bummer... that's who "disconnected" me from the callback system.


@Delta Hello! When do you open up bookings for November and December 2017?


@Delta @DeltaAssist yall might be alright. Usually forced to fly American but an upgrade coming and going is alright with me


@delta i emailed your team re: an issue im having with the delta x air bnb stuff and havent heard back. #sos #whocanicontact


@Delta ok thank you


@SouthwestAir Its a simple job but yet full of untrained people been sitting here for an hour


@AmericanAir Don't get why my boarding pass didn't work at security.


@SouthwestAir how about you hire some employees that will simply drive a bus over to pick us up off the airplane but yet were sitting here
